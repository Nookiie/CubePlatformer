1-	On click --> jump():
		player.Y += ??px every ms for 0.5 seconds?
	
2-	fall():
		if (*collision*==false && time after last *jump* > 0.5s) --> player.Y -= ??px every ms until *collision*.
------
3-	while jumping/falling --> cannot click!
------
4-	Collision:
		1-with Spike		=dead
		2-with side of Platform	=dead
		3-with top  of Platform	=alive, player.Y=collision.Y until next jump/fall
		4-with Ground Zero	=alive, player.y=0
------
5-	Rotation:
		while collision==false --> playerImage.setRotation(playerImage.getRotation() + 5)
		if (collision==True) --> rotation=0
------
------
6-	Level Generation:
		Save the X coordinate where final piece of current Module was placed. 
		Calculate time until final piece appears on screen.
		Start next module after last piece appears.
------
7-	Generate Ground Zero:
		Should it just be the bottom of the screen? No need to generate anything?
