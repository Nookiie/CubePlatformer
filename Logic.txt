1-	On click:
		jump():
			player.y+=some pixels every millisecond for 0.5 seconds?
		fall():
			after jump(), player falls until *collision*.
------
2-	while falling-> cannot click!
------
3-	Collision:
		1-with Spike		=dead
		2-with side of Platform	=dead
		3-with top  of Platform	=alive, player stays at current Y
		4-with Ground Zero	=alive, player.y=0
------
4-	Rotation:
		while (y>0 && collision==false) -> playerImage.setRotation(playerImage.getRotation() + 5)
		If collision==True -> rotation=0
------
------
5-	Level Generation:
		Save the X coordinate where final piece of current Module was placed. 
		Calculate time until final piece appears on screen.
		Start next module after last piece appears.
------
6-	Generate Ground Zero:
		Should it just be the bottom of the screen? No need to generate anything?
